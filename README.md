- API: https://docs.thecatapi.com/ 

- Logic for passing Authentication (it should be possible to enter a API key "x-api-key")
- If user enter a API key "x-api-key", he is able to upload new images
- The application works without authorization also
- All loaded images is saved on the cache
- Infinite scrolling (your UICollectionView should upload fresh portion of cats every time it reaches the end)
- Visually indicates that you are in the process of loading data
- Detailed view. After clicking the cat in the UICollectionView, “full” image opens on a new screen with modal presentation.
- User can save the image to the Galery.
- MVP pattern instead MVC
